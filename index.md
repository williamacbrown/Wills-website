### Summary of the mod

This mod adds two new blocks and 2 new items to the game: The first of which is the "sudoku bag", which can be placed in a chest for a player to find.

When used, it fills the player's hotbar with markers, which can then be used to write numbers into each of the unlocked cells on the floor (each one a unique "sudoku block")

Another unique block- the "sudoku brain"- will check the grid on the floor to see if it is a valid solution to the puzzle or not. If it isn't, it will list all the unique errors made in the chat, like so:

When correct, the player will be congradulated, and they will have completed the puzzle and earned their reward!
